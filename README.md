# erl_egomotion
Code associated with ["Fast, Robust, Continuous Monocular Egomotion Computation"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04886). Implementation of Expected Residual Likelihood and related methods. For sample use of code, see Tests/Sample.m.

This repo uses [Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox](http://petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html) as the implementation of the Epipolar RANSAC cost function. It also expect you to have the [MATLAB Computer Vision toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision/).
